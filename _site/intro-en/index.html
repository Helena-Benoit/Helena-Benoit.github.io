It’s because we love each other, not just because Benoit wants to get the great and shiny Czech citizenship which would allow him to change the course of our country during the next presidential elections. Many of you know our story, but I know that it has been tedious to follow us as we are always travelling somewhere. I will summarize the great lines here.</p> <p>Our story has been pretty simple, if you don’t count frequent travelling, moving to two different countries and, of course, organizing a wedding with families on two different continents. We met in August 2015, in Montreal, when I started my Master at McGill University. Benoit and I were sharing an office at the time. Our first unofficial date was about a month later, during the Super Blood Moon eclipse on September 27th.</p> <p>We first tested our relationship during our first hiking trip in the US. There, we nearly died… The weather near the top was so extreme that my tears of suffering were freezing straight away and walking was impossible due to strong winds (even Benoit’s Canadian skin was not enough to keep him protected). Well surprisingly, we made it back down and we even got out first picture together.</p> <figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/can1.jpg" /> <figcaption>Mt. Katahdin, Maine, USA, or as far as we made it before turning around and trying to make it alive to the car.</figcaption> </figure> <p>We stayed in Canada for a good two years. More travels awaited us like my 3-month trip in Japan in 2016 and Benoit’s 8-month trip to the CERN laboratory in 2017. Despite all of this, we found ways to see each other like during our trip in Thailand during the Spring. Montreal remained a central place for us. Towards the end of my Master, I got the opportunity to start a PhD in London. Benoit decided to follow me and write his PhD thesis there. That was the best way to avoid getting new work from his supervisor and hopefully finish soon. Before leaving from England, my parents visited Canada. With them, we travelled to the Rocky Mountained and visited the farm of Benoit’s family.</p> <figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/can5.jpg" /> <figcaption>The Pikhart family in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Since then, we try keeping our fingers and toes unfrozen during our outdoor adventures. We still travel and move a lot. At the moment we live in France next to Geneva. However, since none of our families lives here, we decided to organize our wedding in the Czech Republic which makes it easier for at least one of them. Thanks for reading our story and hopefully see you at the wedding! :-)</p> <figure><img src="/assets/img/posts/can2.jpg" /> <figcaption>One of our canoe trips during the fall in Canada.</figcaption> </figure> <!--<div class="entry-meta"> <br> <hr> <span class="entry-tags"></span> <span class="social-share"> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=http://localhost:4000/intro-en/" title="Share on Facebook" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-facebook-square"></i> Share</span> </a> <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=http://localhost:4000/intro-en/" title="Share on Twitter" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-twitter-square"></i> Tweet</span> </a> <a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=http://localhost:4000/intro-en/" title="Share on Google+" class="tag"> <span class="term"><i class="fa fa-google-plus-square"></i> +1</span> </a> </span> <div style="clear:both"></div> </div> </div> </div> </header> <!-- MathJax -> <script async src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML"></script> --> </body> </html>
