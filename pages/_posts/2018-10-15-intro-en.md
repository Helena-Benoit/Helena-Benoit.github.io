Hello,

The time has come, Benoit and I are getting married! It's because we love each
other, not just because Benoit wants to get the great and shiny Czech
citizenship which would allow him to change the course of our country during the
next presidential elections. Many of you know our story, but I know that it has
been tedious to follow us as we are always travelling somewhere. I will
summarize the great lines here.

Our story has been pretty simple, if you don't count frequent travelling, moving
to two different countries and, of course, organizing a wedding with families on
two different continents. We met in August 2015, in Montreal, when I started my
Master at McGill University. Benoit and I were sharing an office at the
time. Our first unofficial date was about a month later, during the Super Blood
Moon eclipse on September 27th.

We first tested our relationship during our first hiking trip in the US. There,
we nearly died... The weather near the top was so extreme that my tears of
suffering were freezing straight away and walking was impossible due to strong
winds (even Benoit's Canadian skin was not enough to keep him protected). Well
surprisingly, we made it back down and we even got out first picture together.

car.</figcaption> </figure>

We stayed in Canada for a good two years. More travels awaited us like my
3-month trip in Japan in 2016 and Benoit's 8-month trip to the CERN laboratory
in 2017. Despite all of this, we found ways to see each other like during our
trip in Thailand during the Spring. Montreal remained a central place for
us. Towards the end of my Master, I got the opportunity to start a PhD in
London. Benoit decided to follow me and write his PhD thesis there. That was the
best way to avoid getting new work from his supervisor and hopefully finish
soon. Before leaving from England, my parents visited Canada. With them, we
travelled to the Rocky Mountained and visited the farm of Benoit's family.

Since then, we try keeping our fingers and toes unfrozen during our outdoor
adventures. We still travel and move a lot. At the moment we live in France next to
Geneva. However, since none of our families lives here, we decided to organize
our wedding in the Czech Republic which makes it easier for at least one of
them. Thanks for reading our story and hopefully see you at the wedding! :-)
