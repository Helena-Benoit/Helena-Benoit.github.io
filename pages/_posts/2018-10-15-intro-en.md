Hello,

the time has come and Benoit and I are getting merried! It is because we love each other, not just because Benoit wants to get the great and shiny Czech citizenship which would allow him to change the course of our country during the next presidential elections.

Our story has been pretty simple if you don't count frequent travelling, moving to two different countries and of course organizing a wedding with family on two different continents. We met in August 2015, when I started my masters at McGill University and Benoit and I were sharing an office. Our first unofficial date was about a month later, during the Super Blood Moon eclipse on September 27th.

We started testing our relationship during our first hiking trip in the US, where we nearly died. Somehow the weather near the top was so extreme that my tears of suffering were freezing straight away and walking was impossible due to strong wind (Even Benoit's Canadian skin was not enough to keep him protected). Well surprisingly, we made it back down and we even got the first picture of us together.

Since then, we try to keep our fingers and toes unfrozen during our outdoor adventures. We travel and move a lot, at the moment we live in France on the border with Geneva. However since none of our families lives here, we decided to organize our wedding in Czech Republic, to make it easier for at least one family. Thanks for reading our story and hopefully see you at our wedding! :)
