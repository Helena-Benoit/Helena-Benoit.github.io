### Where?

In the Gardens bellow the Prague Castle (Valdštejnská 14, Prague 1, Czech Republic).

The closest subway and tramway stations are at Malostranska, after which you can walk through Valdstejnska until you reach the gardens.

### Should I bring a gift?

The most important thing for us is your presence during the day to celebrate our marriage and gifts are by no means expected. If however, you do feel you would like to give something, then some spending money to enjoy whilst on our dream honeymoon would be very much appreciated.

### What should I wear?

Anything you want, there is no dress code! Check the weather closer to the date and keep in mind the ceremony will be outside. 

### Can I bring someone?
