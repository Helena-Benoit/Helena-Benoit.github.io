The ceremony will last for approximately one hour and will be followed by a
cocktail and a photo shooting in the Gardens. A dinner will follow in the
evening in the city of Prague. More details will follow soon...


### What should I wear?

Anything you want, there is no dress code! Check the weather closer to the date and keep in mind the ceremony will be outside. 

### Can I bring someone?

Of course! Be it a friend or a lover, don't forget to mention that person in
your RSVP.


### Will there be a name change?

Helena will be taking Benoit's last name and after the ceremony will be Helena Lefebvre.

### What about gifts?

We have everything we need after living together for a while, and only ask that you share our special day. However, if you wanted to make a monetary contribution, we would be most grateful, but please do not feel obliged to do so.
