### When is the wedding?

20.7.2019 at 14:30.

### Where?

In the Gardens bellow the Prague Castle (<a href="https://goo.gl/maps/5QXy6FHM8tR2">Valdštejnská 14, Prague 1, Czech Republic</a>).

The closest subway and tramway stations are at Malostranska, after which you can walk through Valdstejnska until you reach the gardens.

### Schedule of the day

The ceremony will last for approximately one hour and will be followed by a
cocktail and a photo shooting in the Gardens. A dinner will follow in the
evening in the city of Prague. More details will follow soon...


### Should I bring a gift?

The most important thing for us is your presence during the day to celebrate our marriage and gifts are by no means expected. If however, you do feel you would like to give something, then some spending money to enjoy whilst on our dream honeymoon would be very much appreciated.

### What should I wear?

Anything you want, there is no dress code! Check the weather closer to the date and keep in mind the ceremony will be outside. 

### Can I bring someone?

Of course! Be it a friend or a lover, don't forget to mention that person in
your RSVP.
